# Corporate_Diversification

The research was centered on the relationship between corporate diversification and firm value. Three fundamental aspects were addressed: 1) the consensus about the theoretical and empirical nature of the relationship, 2) the study of the research context from an historical approach and 3) the proposal of a measure that quantifies the multivariable nature of corporate diversification.
